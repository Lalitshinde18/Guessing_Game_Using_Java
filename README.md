# Guessing_Game_Using_Java
i have created simple guessing game 
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, with the game providing hints after each guess.
It's a fun and interactive way to practice Java programming concepts like:

Random number generation
User input handling
Control flow with loops and conditionals

# Features
Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the player to guess.
Provides feedback:
"Too low" if the guess is smaller than the target number.
"Too high" if the guess is larger than the target number.
"Congratulations" when the guess is correct.
Tracks the number of attempts made by the player.
Ensures user input is within the valid range of 1 to 100.
Uses clean and modular code with a constructor and methods for clarity.

# Future Improvements
Add difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
Allow the player to set a custom range.
Implement a multiplayer mode.
